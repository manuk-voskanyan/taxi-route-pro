# 🔐 Authentication Issue - CRITICAL FIX NEEDED

## 🚨 **Problem Identified:**

Your chat is showing "no messages" because of an **authentication issue**:

- **Server runs on**: `localhost:3001`
- **NextAuth cookies set for**: `localhost:3000`
- **Result**: API calls return `401 Unauthorized`

## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE FIX:**

### **Option 1: Force Port 3000 (Recommended)**
Kill the process using port 3000 and restart on correct port:

```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
sudo lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Start your server on port 3000
npm run dev
```

### **Option 2: Update NextAuth Configuration**
Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Then restart the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 **Testing After Fix:**

1. **Clear browser cookies**:
   - Press F12 → Application → Storage → Clear storage
   - Or use incognito/private window

2. **Sign in again**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3001/auth/signin`
   - Login with your credentials

3. **Test messaging**:
   - Go to trips page
   - Open chat with someone
   - Send a message - it should now save and appear in chat history!

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working:**

**In browser console (F12), you should see:**
```
Fetching messages for trip: xxxxx driver: yyyyy
Current user: [user-id] [user-name]
Messages fetch response: 200 {messages: [...]}
Loaded X messages
```

**Instead of:**
```
Messages fetch response: 401 {error: "Unauthorized"}
```

## 🎯 **Root Cause:**

NextAuth was configured for port 3000, but when another process occupied that port, Next.js automatically switched to 3001. However, the authentication cookies remained tied to port 3000, causing all authenticated API calls to fail.

**Try Option 1 first (kill port 3000 process), then test the chat again!** 🚀
